# A tokamak radial build, ordered radially outward from the plasma. If differentiation
# between the inboard and outboard is desired, separate lists of the desired material
# layers must be made for each, headed by "Inboard" and "Outboard". Otherwise, a single
# list represents a tokamak that is radially symmetric.

# The example given below differentiates between the inboard and outboard.
