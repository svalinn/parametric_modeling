# A tokamak radial build, ordered radially outward from the plasma. If differentiation
# between the inboard and outboard is desired, separate lists of the desired material
# layers must be made for each, headed by "Inboard" and "Outboard". Otherwise, a single
# list represents a tokamak that is radially symmetric.

# The example given below differentiates between the inboard and outboard.

# Format
# ------
# <region>:
#   <material_layer>: <thickness [cm]>

# Based on the FESS-FNSF

# Note that for DAGMC geometries the word "vacuum" cannot be included in any part of the
# material layer name unless the user wants that region to be treated as vacuum.
