# A tokamak radial build, ordered radially outward from the plasma. If differentiation
# between the inboard and outboard is desired, separate lists of the desired material
# layers must be made for each, headed by "Inboard" and "Outboard". Otherwise, a single
# list represents a tokamak that is radially symmetric.

# The example given below is radially symmetric.

# Format
# ------
# - <material_layer>: <thickness [cm]>

# Based on the FESS-FNSF

# Note that for DAGMC geometries the word "vacuum" cannot be included in any part of the
# material layer name unless the user wants that region to be treated as vacuum.

# Note the repeated layer names. Specifying a volume of interest within a region (e.g.
# the 0.5 cm thick layers) is useful for various applications, while maintaining the same
# layer name renders an additional material definition unecesary, at least if OpenMC is
# used.
